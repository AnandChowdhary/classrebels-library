# Class Rebels Author

A Simple PHP file manager to let students access study material on Class Rebels.

## ⚠️ Archive Notice

In 2014, I co-founded an edtech startup, Class Rebels. One of our core products was a Virtual Library, which lets students upload PDFs of their study notes and share it with their classmates (and the world). This repository, a fork of a PHP file manager, was used to store and view files on a shared server.

## Why it is good

- Single file, there are no images, or css folders.  
- Ajax based so it is fast, but doesn't break the back button
- Allows drag and drop file uploads if folder is writable by the webserver
- Suits my aesthetics.  More like Dropbox, and less like Windows Explorer
- Works with Unicode file names
- The interface is usable from an iPad
- XSRF protection (though no authentication system)

## Changes needed

- Make it responsive
- Add branding, etc.
- **Add text editor and PDF viewer**
