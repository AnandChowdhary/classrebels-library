Class Rebels Author
===================

A Simple PHP file manager to let students access study material on Class Rebels.

## Why it is good

- Single file, there are no images, or css folders.  
- Ajax based so it is fast, but doesn't break the back button
- Allows drag and drop file uploads if folder is writable by the webserver
- Suits my aesthetics.  More like Dropbox, and less like Windows Explorer
- Works with Unicode file names
- The interface is usable from an iPad
- XSRF protection (though no authentication system)

## Changes needed

- Make it responsive
- Add branding, etc.
- **Add text editor and PDF viewer**
